## Finding issues you can help with
Looking for something to work on?
[Issues marked *good first issue*](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/labels/good%20first%20issue)
are a good place to start.

You can also check [the *help wanted* tag](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/labels/help%20wanted)
to find other issues to help with.

## Contributions
We welcome your contributions to the legibelle project, especially to fix bugs and to make
improvements which address the top issues reported by legibelle hard core users.

### Preparing your development environment
To learn how to build the code and run tests, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md).

### Git workflow
Calculator uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) where most
development happens directly on the `master` branch. The `master` branch should always be in a
healthy state which is ready for release.

If your change is complex, please clean up the branch history before submitting a pull request.
You can use [git rebase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/rebase#squash-local-commits)
to group your changes into a small number of commits which we can review one at a time.

When completing a pull request, we will generally squash your changes into a single commit. Please
let us know if your pull request needs to be merged as separate commits.

## Submitting a pull request and participating in code review
Writing a good description for your pull request is crucial to help reviewers and future
maintainers understand your change. More detail is better.
- [Link the issue you're addressing in the pull request](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions).
- Describe *why* the change is being made and *why* you've chosen a particular solution.
- Describe any manual testing you performed to validate your change.

Please submit one pull request per issue. Large pull requests which have unrelated changes can be
difficult to review.

After submitting a pull request, members of the calculator team will review your code. We will
assign the request to an appropriate reviewer within two days. Any member of the community may
participate in the review, but at least one member of the Calculator team will ultimately approve
the request.

Often, multiple iterations will be needed to responding to feedback from reviewers. Try looking at
[past pull requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to see
what the experience might be like.
